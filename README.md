# Forms-Web-Page

This project is a web page with a user-created form using the Vue framework. The basic requirements have been implemented, and the following describes how to run it.

Locate the form directory, type '''npm run serve''' in terminal, wait for building to complete, and click on the generated localhost link. Of course, you can also watch the demo video in the same directory. Thanks!
